:: Informational API for tilde.institute ::

This allows one to request information and stats via HTTP requests. The GET and
HEAD methods are allowed. All others will receive a 405 response.

Not finished. Currently planning:

    FMT = /{plain|json}
        - Plaintext or JSON formatted responses

    $FMT/osversion
        - OpenBSD version

    $FMT/pkgs
        - Installed packages

    $FMT/query
        ?pkg=[a-zA-Z0-9+]
            - Check if a package is installed.

    $FMT/uptime
        - Uptime and Load

    $FMT/usercount
        - Number of registered user accounts

    $FMT/users
        - List of users (maybe CSV for plaintext?) and ancillary information


I'll use some kind of fast hash as an etag.

Probably going to add more endpoints.
